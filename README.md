## Project description

In this project I created the client-side using React from my movie-api database. In it you can register as a user and navigate through the app. You can add movies to your favorites list as well as remove them, search for a movie and update your user. The app shows you important information about each movie when you click on it. By this project, I complete a web application (client-side and server-side movie-api) known as MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js).

## Objective

Using React, build the client-side for an application called artHouseMovie based on its existing server-side code (REST API and MongoDB).

## Getting started

Download the project code. Once you have it, run in the terminal `npm install` to download all the dependencies. Once the dependencies are downloaded run `npm start` script which will open the page at `http://localhost:1234/`.
